The younger Carter's heart stopped, the minister said, and the family tried CPR and rushed him to a hospital. They were trying to keep his heart going and eventually, later in the night or the wee hours of (Sunday) morning, his heart stopped, Shoulta said. Despite the tragic loss, the former President taught Sunday school as he has for many years, Shoulta said. (President Carter) was shaken, he said. He was obviously sad although he was able to teach and he was able to present the lesson as well as he always has. But it was apparent to everyone there that this was weighing on him very heavily. During his sermon, Shoulta urged congregants to pray for the Carter family.
